Vrilda - The virtual reality laser show player
By Gitle Mikkelsen / Grix / GrixM / gitlem@gmail.com

Super early alpha build, nothing works perfectly and features are lacking.

Quick start guide for watching a show using the Oculus Rift: 

Plug in the Rift before you open the program.
Load the main ilda file and audio file at startup when asked. If the show uses flanking projectors (if there are more than one .ild file),
press N to load the secondary ilda file as well. Press Tab to go 3D. If you wish you can now adjust the environment using the
controls found below. When you are ready, press O to enter Oculus Rift mode. 
Then press space to start playback. Lean back and enjoy the show.


Controls are as follows (will likely change in following releases):
