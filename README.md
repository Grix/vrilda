Vrilda - The virtual reality laser show player
By Gitle Mikkelsen / Grix / GrixM / gitlem@gmail.com

Made in Game Maker: Studio, you will unfortunately need this program to make contributions to Vrilda. (Unless you feel like porting it)

--------
Super early alpha build, nothing works perfectly and features are lacking.

When opening the program, you will be asked to load an ilda file containing the laser show. 
Only ilda formats 4 and 5 are supported as of now.
Please allow some time for parsing the ilda file, this can take over a minute depending on the file size and processing power.
You will then be asked to load a matching song if you want. Most audio filetypes are supported.
If your show uses flanking projectors, press N to enable them and load a second ilda file.
By using WASD to move and a combination of the keys RTYFGH and your mouse you can edit various settings real-time.


Controls are as follows (will likely change in following releases):

Tab:  				Switch between 2D and 3D mode
Space: 				Play/Pause show
